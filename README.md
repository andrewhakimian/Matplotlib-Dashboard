This file contains an assignment from my data visualization class (CIS 9655) at Baruch College. I utilized the multiple Python libraries in order to display a grid of visuals based on the dataset linked below. My dashboard displays data regarding video game sales and hones in on Super Mario Bros. in particular and the success that it had when it was initially released.
