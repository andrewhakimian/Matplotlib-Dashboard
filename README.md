# Super Mario Bros. Dashboard

The IPYNB file in this repository contains an assignment completed in my data visualization class (CIS 9655) during my master's studies at Baruch College. I utilized matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas python libraries in order to manipulate data and plot a dashboard in a grid based on the dataset linked below. My dashboard displays data regarding global video game sales and it hones in on Super Mario Bros. in particular, and the success that it had when it was initially released.
